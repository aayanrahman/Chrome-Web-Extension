# Random Font Size Changer

## Introduction 
This may very well be the most useless Chrome extension you could ever possibly use. Introducing the Random Font Size Changer, a Chrome extension that makes it feel like you have dyslexia. I made it using JavaScript, HTML, and a little bit of JSON.

The idea for this project came from Hack Club's Arcade random idea generator, which told me to make an extension that changes the font size randomly on any website you choose to visit.

## Installation and use 

### 1. Download the Extension Files
- Download the extension files from the repository or alternatively, download the zip file of the code.

### 2. Load the Extension in Your Browser
- Open your browser (Chrome works best).
- Go to chrome://extensions/.
- Enable "Developer mode" (toggle on top right).
- Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you saved the extension files.
  
### 3. Using the Extension
- Click the extension icon (heart) to open the popup.
- Set your desired minimum and maximum font sizes.
- Enable the extension by checking the box.
- Enjoy making reading anything off your webpage a huge chore!
